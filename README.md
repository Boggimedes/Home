## My Portfolio Site
You make strange decisions when you make a portfolio site.  For example I'm running both NodeJS and PHP on this setup.  Currently am not doing anything with the Node side of things, just have some boilerplate there from react-slingshot, but I hope inspiration will strike me and I'll come up with something interesting to code to make me look good.  For now this is just a pretty site that introduces you to yours truly.  Check it out here: <a href="boggs.design/portfolio/daniel">Boggs.Design/portfolio/daniel</a>
